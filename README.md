# Ocean: Multi-Modal Question & Answer Bot

## Description

Ocean is a Multi-Modal Question & Answer Bot designed to interact with users through the Telegram messaging platform. It provides answers to text-based questions and questions accompanied by images, utilizing advanced AI models to generate responses. Ocean is a versatile tool for a variety of user queries.

## Key Features

### Text-based Question Answering

- Users can ask any question by sending a text message to the bot.
- The bot processes the question using the LLamaChatBot model and provides a text response.

### Image-based Question Answering

- Users can send an image with their question, and the bot uses the LLaVAChatBot model to analyze both the image and the text prompt.
- The bot saves the image, processes it, and generates an appropriate response considering both inputs.

### Feedback System

- After receiving an answer, users are prompted to rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5.
- Users can provide specific feedback if the response is not satisfactory (e.g., too long, too short, inaccurate, or irrelevant).
- The bot uses this feedback to improve subsequent answers.

### Chat Management

- Users can clear the chat history and start a new conversation using the `/newchat` command.
- The bot maintains the context of the conversation, allowing for a continuous and coherent dialogue.

## Workflow

### 1. Starting the Bot

- Users initiate interaction with the bot using the `/start` command.
- The bot welcomes the user and prompts them to ask a question or send an image.

### 2. Handling User Inputs

#### Initial Input

- If the user sends a text message, the bot asks if they have an image to accompany the question.
- If the user sends an image, the bot saves the image and asks for the associated question.

#### Image Option

- If the user confirms they have an image, they are prompted to send it.
- If not, the bot processes the text question using the LLamaChatBot model and responds accordingly.

### 3. Processing Inputs

#### Text-Only

- The bot uses the LLamaChatBot model to generate a response based on the user's question.

#### Text and Image

- The bot saves the image and uses the LLaVAChatBot model to process both the image and the text prompt to generate a comprehensive response.

### 4. Providing Feedback

- After receiving a response, users can rate the answer.
- Based on the rating and feedback, the bot can re-generate the answer to better meet the user's expectations.
